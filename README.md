## Description

This project is a result of the [The Next.js 13 Bootcamp - The Complete Developer Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-nextjs-13-bootcamp-the-complete-developer-guide), where we built a restaurant reservation application using the features of NextJS 13. The course covered a wide range of topics, from exploring the file system to handling loading, error, success, and not found states, and delving into the rendering modes of React components.
